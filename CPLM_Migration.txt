CPaLAMeM Migration into preAlps TODOLIST

1. [Done] Copy all CPaLAMeM MatCSR_ routines required by preAlps in preAlps_cplm_matcsr.{h/c}
2. [Done] Copy all CPaLAMeM MatDense_ routines required by preAlps in preAlps_cplm_matdense.{h/c}
3. [Done] Copy all CPaLAMeM IVector_/Dvector_ routines required by preAlps in preAlps_{ivector/dvector}.{h/c}
4. [Done] Remove CPaLAMeM.tar.gz from preAlps
5. Create a directory utils/cpalamem_light which will contain routines of CPaLAMeM which does not use ivector/dvector
5. Create preAlps_{iarray/darray}.{h/c} in order to store vector routines based on int* and double*
6. Convert IVector_/Dvector_ routines to IArray_/DArray routines and update preAlps routines.
7. Remove preAlps_{ivector/dvector}.{h/c} from preAlps
8. When CPaLAMeM lib is ready, move all inexistent MatCSR_/MatDense_/IArray_/DArray_ routines from preAlps to CPaLAMeM lib.
